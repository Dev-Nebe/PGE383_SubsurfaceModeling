#### Join Us

Come and join us as we learn more about subsurface data analytics, modeling and statistical / machine learning. 

* The Lectures: During the term I will record the lectures and place them on youtube.

* The project: There is an dataset for you to work with, or use your own.

* Updates: check out our project updates as we work through this term-long subsurface modeling project.

* Opensource: work in Jupyter Notebook with workflow development in Python.

* GeostatsPy: GSLIB functionality in Python for great experiential learning.

* Professional: class is conducted like a subsurface asset team with myself as the subsurface asset team lead. Practice professional communication, oral and written reporting.

Here's how you get started:

* [Course Lectures on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g1g3gtHYSE&list=PLG19vXLQHvSDUmEOmBoaxGbFAbvaLdfx4)

I will also place the course hands-on demos in this repository:

* [Coure Workflows and Demonstrations GitHub](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy)
 
The Python Jupyter workflow links are provided in the lecture videos. The workflows will come from my PythonNumericalDemos and ExcelNumericalDemos repositories.

An example dataset, similar to the ones provided to the project teams is available in this repository.

1. 0_sample_data.csv - comma delimited well data with X and Y coordinates (meters), Facies 0 and 1 (1 is sandstone and 0 interbedded sand and mudstone), Porosity (fraction), permeability as Perm (mDarcy) and acoustic impedance as AI (kg/m2s*10^6). 

2. 0_AI.csv - 2D comma delimited array with acoustic impedance (kg/m2s*10^6) at 10 m cell resolution over the area of itnerest X [0,1000m] and Y [0,1000m].

I will upload my updates as:

* recorded oral presentation on YouTube.
* update report in .pdf in this repository.

#### Comments

I hope you join us in my PGE 383: Subsurface Modeling class. We have about 40 graduate students from engineering and geoscience participating.  The Jackson School of Geosciences offered a new classroom in their building when we outgrew our room in the Petroleum and Geosystems engineering department. 

I hope that this is helpful to those that want to learn more about subsurface modeling, data analytics and machine learning.    I will add these results to a short update summary (word doc and presentation).

* If you work for a company and would like me to visit for training, mentoring, project review, workflow design and consulting, I'd be happy to drop by and work with you!  Even better, if you would like to hear more about and partner with my graduate student research and consortium drop me a line at mpyrcz@austin.utexas.edu.

I hope this was helpful,

*Michael*
