#### Join Us

Come and join us as we learn more about subsurface data analytics, modeling and statistical / machine learning. 

* **The Lectures**: During the term I will record the lectures and place them on YouTube.

* **The Project**: There is a dataset for you to work with, or use your own.

* **Updates**: check out our project updates as we work through this term-long subsurface modeling project.

* **Opensource**: work in Jupyter Notebook with workflow development in Python.

* **GeostatsPy**: GSLIB++ functionality in Python for great, efficient experiential learning.

* **Professional Communicaton**: class is conducted like a subsurface asset team with myself as the subsurface asset team lead. Practice professional communication, oral and written reporting.

#### Getting Started

To get started, check out these course resources and begin your journey.

* **The Recorded Lectures** are available at [Course Lectures on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g1g3gtHYSE&list=PLG19vXLQHvSDUmEOmBoaxGbFAbvaLdfx4)

* **The Hands-on Demos** are available in this repository [Coure Workflows and Demonstrations GitHub](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy) 
 
The Python Jupyter workflow links are provided in the lecture videos. The workflows will come from my PythonNumericalDemos and ExcelNumericalDemos repositories.

An example dataset, similar to the ones provided to the project teams is available in this repository.

1. **0_sample_data.csv** - comma delimited well data with X and Y coordinates (meters), Facies 0 and 1 (1 is sandstone and 0 interbedded sand and mudstone), Porosity (fraction), permeability as Perm (mDarcy) and acoustic impedance as AI (kg/m2s*10^6). 

2. **0_AI.csv** - 2D comma delimited array with acoustic impedance (kg/m2s*10^6) at 10 m cell resolution over the area of itnerest X [0,1000m] and Y [0,1000m].

I will upload my and other student teams' updates as:

* recorded oral presentation on YouTube.
* update report in .pdf in this repository.

Here's my first recorded oral and written update for basic univariate and spatial analysis of dataset 12:

#### Comments

I hope you join us in my PGE 383: Subsurface Modeling class. We have about 40 graduate students from engineering and geoscience participating here at the University of Texas at Austin. The Jackson School of Geosciences offered a new classroom in their building after we outgrew our room in the Petroleum and Geosystems engineering department. I appreciate the excellent support from both the Hidebrand Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering and the Jackson School of Geosciences.

I hope that this is helpful to those that want to learn more about subsurface modeling, data analytics and machine learning. Students and working professionals are welcome to participate.

* If you work for a company and would like me to visit for training, mentoring, project review, workflow design and consulting, I'd be happy to drop by and work with you! 

* If you would like to partner and support my graduate student research and consortium drop me a line at mpyrcz@austin.utexas.edu.  My research combines data analytics, stochastic modeling and machine learning theory with practice to develop novel methods and workflows to add value. We are solving challenging subsurface problems!

I'm always happy to discuss,

*Michael*
